Brian's Tacos- CS 180- Winter 2012

This was a project for my software engineering class. We had to make an Android and Web applcation that supported online ordering and table reservations for a restaurant.

Brian's Tacos the the name of our fake restaurant we created the application for. We have all the major features working and did this in about 4-5 weeks on top of school.
